The following two functions in ChargeDensityModule need to be
checked on the use n_mult.
getChrgDen_r
getMomDen_r
Note that in function getChrgDen_r, n_mult is multiplied to the core density
on the grid points outside the atomic cell. This essentially means that
the core densities contributed by the nearby atoms are not avaraged, but rather
are summed up. The idea behind this is that if a neighboring grid point is 
outside the atomic cell, the charge density contribution from the
atom to the grid point is the single site core density.
On the other hand, n_mult is not actually used in getMomDen_r, so that 
the outside grid points are not treated in the exact same way as in
getChrgDen_r. This might be a bug, and it needs to be looked into further.
